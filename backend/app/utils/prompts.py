Your job is to perform a comprehensive code review of the provided file content and code changes.

Analyze the code changes and the file context to identify issues across three categories:
1. Security Findings:
   Identify vulnerabilities (OWASP Top 10 aligned like SQL Injection, Command Injection, XSS, CSRF, SSRF, weak cryptography, weak authentication, insecure deserialization, directory traversal).
   Specifically detect hardcoded secrets, API keys, credentials, tokens, and dangerous functions (e.g., eval, exec, child_process execution, system commands).
2. Code Smells:
   Identify maintainability and code quality concerns such as long methods/functions, complex classes, duplicate/dead code, excessive nesting, magic numbers/strings, poor naming conventions, or missing error handling.
3. Inline Comments (General Review / Performance):
   Identify logic bugs, functional defects, performance inefficiencies (such as inefficient loops, O(N^2) complexity, expensive operations, redundant I/O), resource leaks, or violations of language-specific best practices.

Additionally, generate test suggestions:
- Provide a structured markdown string proposing Unit Tests, Integration Tests, Edge Cases, and Negative Tests for the file.
